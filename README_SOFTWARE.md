Software and Firmware Report
=================

### Installation

Here is a comprehensive guide on how to setup the software necessary to run the Personal Alert Device system, including the firmware running on the device's XIAO nRF52840 Sense microcontroller. While the mobile app will be eventually released for download on the Google Play store in one package, instructions are also provided for developers or testers who wish to build and run the app manually from the source code. This includes setting up the Android development environment, cloning the project repository, configuring Firebase services, and enabling the necessary permissions. Additionally, guidance is provided on how to connect the app to the wearable device via Bluetooth and how to test emergency alerts, sensor data streaming, and backend integration with services like Firestore and Adafruit IO.
